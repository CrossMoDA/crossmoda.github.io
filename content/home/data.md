### London SC-GK data

All images were obtained on a 32-channel Siemens Avanto 1.5T scanner using a Siemens single-channel head coil:
- Contrast-enhanced T1-weighted imaging was performed with an MPRAGE sequence with in-plane resolution of 0.4×0.4mm, in-plane matrix of 512×512, and slice thickness of 1.0 to 1.5 mm (TR=1900 ms, TE=2.97 ms, TI=1100 ms)
- High-resolution T2-weighted imaging was performed with a 3D CISS or FIESTA sequence in-plane resolution of 0.5x0.5mm, in-plane matrix of 384x384 or 448x448, and slice thickness of 1.0 to 1.5 mm (TR=9.4 ms, TE=4.23ms).

### Tilburg SC-GK data

All images were obtained on a Philips Ingenia 1.5T scanner using a Philips quadrature head coil:
- Contrast enhanced T1-weighted imaging was performed with a 3D-FFE sequence with in-plane resolution of 0.8×0.8mm, in-plane matrix of 256×256, and slice thickness of 1.5 mm (TR=25 ms, TE=1.82 ms).
- High-resolution T2-weighted imaging was performed with a 3D-TSE sequence with in-plane resolution of 0.4x0.4mm, in-plane matrix of 512×512, and slice thickness of 1.0 mm (TR=2700 ms, TE=160 ms, ETL=50).

All structures were manually segmented in consensus by the treating neurosurgeon and physicist using both the ceT1 and hrT2 images.

### UK MC-RC data:

Images were obtained on various scanners from SIEMENS, Philips, General Electrics, Hitachi MRI scanners with the magnetic field strengths 1.0T/1.5T/3.0T. Slice thickness, voxel volume and intensities vary significantly across all ceT1 weighted and T2 weighted imaging (see [here](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.08.01.22278193v1.full.pdf) for more details).
