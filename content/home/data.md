All images were obtained on a 32-channel Siemens Avanto 1.5T scanner using a Siemens single-channel head coil:
- Contrast-enhanced T1-weighted imaging was performed with an MPRAGE sequence with in-plane resolution of
0.4×0.4 mm, in-plane matrix of 512×512, and slice thickness of 1.0 to 1.5 mm (TR=1900 ms, TE=2.97 ms, TI=1100 ms)
- High-resolution T2-weighted imaging was performed with a 3D CISS or FIESTA sequence in-plane resolution of 0.5x0.5 mm, in-plane matrix of 384x384 or 448x448, and slice thickness of 1.0 to 1.5 mm (TR=9.4 ms,
TE=4.23ms).

All structures were manually segmented in consensus by the treating neurosurgeon and physicist using both the ceT1 and hrT2 images.
