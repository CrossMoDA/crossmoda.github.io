# Patient and public involvment
Hyperspectral imaging systems allow us to interpret bands of light beyond what the naked eye can see.  It has already been used to great effect in other industries and has begun to show some promise within clinical practice.  Our novel system employs this technology into the neurosurgical theatre with the expectation that it will be able to provide valuable, live information to the surgeon allowing them to carry out safer operations for our patients.

The purpose of this study is to assess the quality of data obtained by our system and how well it integrates into current neurosurgical practice.  We are currently running a public engagement group that had its [first meeting on 9th February 2022](/post/2022-02-10-ppineurosurg/), providing valuable to our research team on this study.

We plan to meet 6 monthly to annually. If this is something you would like to be involved in please use the [contact form](/neurohsi/#contact).  Similarly, if you would like more information about what the study entails from a patient perspective, please take a look at our {{% staticref "uploads/ScienceForTomorrowsNeurosurgeryPamphlet_Feb22.pdf" %}}study pamphlet{{% /staticref %}} and our patient information sheets (PIS):
