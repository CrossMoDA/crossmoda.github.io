# The study
A study to demonstrate that a novel, light based, imaging system could be used in neurosurgical procedures in the future with a view to improving outcomes

# The key points
- Will not affect your operation or outcome
- Study to assess whether the system is capable of obtaining helpful images for surgical guidance in the future
- May add a maximum of 15 minutes to your operation time in order to obtain these images but no other aspect of the procedure will be carried out any differently
- No radiation, the system uses safe light only
- No additional follow-up visits or contact required
