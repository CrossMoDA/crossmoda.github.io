# Plain English Summary of the NeuroHSI research project
Brain surgery operations include brain tumour removal and blood vessel procedures. Each year in the UK, approximately 70,500 patients are diagnosed with a brain tumour, 5,000 of whom undergo surgery. Approximately 1,000 patients undergo blood vessel brain surgery. Brain tumour surgery involves removing as much of the tumour as safely as possible. If all tumour is removed, patients have significantly better outcomes and live longer.

However, even with the best hands and the most modern technology currently available, it is often not possible to reliably identify tumour during surgery. Moreover, nerves and blood vessels cannot be reliably identified either during surgery. Yet, they need to be preserved to avoid brain damage. Due to this uncertainty and the need to balance risks, tumour is often left behind. Today, close to 30% of brain tumour patients require repeat surgery owing to tumour left behind during their first surgery. Further surgeries are more difficult, pose additional patient risks and lead to increased healthcare costs with often poor patient outcomes.

Newly developed camera systems have the potential to enhance the surgeon s vision to reliably identify tumour and healthy brain structures. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is one of the most promising of such technologies. Its core ability is to provide very detailed and rich information that is invisible to the human eye. HSI has demonstrated the potential to provide crucial, but currently unavailable, information about tumour and critical brain structures during surgery. However, HSI data is very complex and requires advanced computer-processing for its interpretation. In two previous clinical studies, we have shown that we can safely integrate our HSI prototype system during surgery.

In this project, we will further advance our prototype, refine our setup and develop key computer-processing features. We will assess our system in a new clinical study involving 81 patients undergoing brain tumour and blood vessel surgery. The outcomes of this study will inform the commercialisation of the technology for patient and NHS benefits.

This study has been designed with patient input and feedback from various patient groups including [The Brain Tumour Charity](https://www.thebraintumourcharity.org/). We received feedback stating that this research in improving surgical outcomes is potentially life-changing, drastically improving patient health, wellbeing and quality of life. The study will form a Patient Advisory Group to advise on all stages of the research. A patient representative, named public co-applicant on the project team, will sit on the study management board. We will ensure that the patient voice is expressed clearly in study reports and when sharing research updates more widely. Results will be made publicly available through publication of open-access research papers, presentation of results at scientific meetings, patient events, and online via King's College London and relevant charity websites/social media.
