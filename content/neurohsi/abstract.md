# Scientific Abstract
To address the pressing clinical need of improved surgical precision and patient safety during neurosurgery, we will develop a medical device capable of contact-free, contrast-agent-free, wide-field imaging and real-time tissue characterisation for seamless surgical guidance. Our innovation relies on advancing data-driven hyperspectral imaging (HSI).

Even though the ability of HSI to differentiate tissue types and measure tissue characteristics is supported by a relatively large body of scientific evidence, to date, commercial HSI systems are used mainly for tissue healing analysis rather than for surgical guidance. Indeed, existing systems are slow (20s per image) and lack sterility features vital for surgical guidance.

This project builds on our previous research with two successful first-in-patient studies demonstrating that our initial intraoperative HSI (iHSI) prototype seamlessly integrates into the surgical workflow. To deliver on this primary objective, our project will pursue eight aims for our iHSI technology:
- Demonstrate clinical safety in neurosurgery
- Establish correlation with histology
- Develop quantitative perfusion algorithms
- Achieve clinical-grade wide-field perfusion estimations
- Demonstrate accurate differentiation of tissue types
- Advance regulatory compliance towards commercialisation
- Dissemination of the research to patients and the public
- Protect innovation and disseminate findings to the research community

Our project plan, executed within a 36-month period, is divided into five work packages (WPs) spanning:
- Clinical implementation (centred on a prospective clinical study involving 81 patients)
- iHSI hardware design and system characterisation
- Real-time computational algorithms design
- Product development following MDR/UKCA-requirements
- Management, PPI and dissemination

The close collaboration between [King's College London](https://kcl.ac.uk), [King's College Hospital](https://www.kch.nhs.uk/) and [Hypervision Surgical Ltd](https://hypervisionsurgical.com/) (King's spin-out) will ensure a fast-tracked conversion from a healthcare innovation into a product achieving accelerated patient and public benefit. By the end of the project, our technology will be ready for MHRA submission and for inclusion in prospective clinical efficacy studies.
