# crossMoDA website
Source files for the crossMoDA website

## Instructions to work on the website
The website uses [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) to generate a static website hosted by [Netlifly](https://www.netlifly.com/).

A custom domain managed on [Freenom.com](https://www.freenom.com) and [netlifly](https://www.netlifly.com/) ensure we serve the website as\
https://crossmoda-challenge.ml \
(including variants with www and/or http).

If you don't have Hugo installed, this will be required. Follow their [quickstart](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/) to get you up to speed.

Initial cloning of the repository requires a recursive clone to pull the template and the generated website:\
`git clone https://github.com/ReubenDo/crossmoda.github.io.git`

One can then work on the website and push changes in the source code and generated website independently.\
`hugo server`\
will generate a local website for development purposes which is accessible under\
http://localhost:1313/ \
by default.
